# Instructor: Activity: Intention Setting Our Careers

## Notes

- It's a bunch of writing questions. A lot about their feelings
    - play chill music if that's cool
    - there can be really cool inspiration and motivation that comes up with individuals. encourage those sparks of inspiration and imagination

- If possible do many small group check-ins, or at least one in the middle.
    - It's a little awkward to wait until the very end to reflect on 5 very emotional questions

- The goal is to start thinking about how tech can be used
    - A nice side effect is using these ideas for capstone
    - or for motivating yourself

- Extend this activity by creating a poster or craft after the activity that represents your answers.
    - seriously!!
