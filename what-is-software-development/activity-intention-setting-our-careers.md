# Activity: Intention Setting Our Careers

<!-- Can be async -->
<!-- But this would probably be really fun and heartwarming to do synchronously -->
<!-- Best in small groups -->

## Goal

Our goal is to help our record our current goals and aspirations in tech at this very moment. Recording our current goals can help us move forward, especially when we reflect on this in the future.

## Activity Instructions

Follow the instructions about how and when to fill in the prompts below. Share in the text box whatever you feel comfortable sharing; we are expecting 1-5 sentences for each prompt. Consider writing longer answers in your own notes!

Write these for your future self.
