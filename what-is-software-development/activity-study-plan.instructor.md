# Instructor: Activity: Study Habits

- Project is best in small groups
- As much as possible, repeat between individual reflection, then small group sharing
- Adapt the timing to what the group needs (aka give them 20 minutes if they need it, give them 3 minutes, etc). This is high priority
- If it feels good, do a large group conclusion, asking people to share their conversations. This is low priority
