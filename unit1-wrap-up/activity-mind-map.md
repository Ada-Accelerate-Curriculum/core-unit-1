# Unit 1 - Reflection Activity

Wow! We've learned so much in the last 5 weeks. Let's take time to reflect on our learning and make connections.

We will use a technique called a mind map. A mind map is a diagram that can represent tasks, ideas, concepts, etc. and the connections between them. In our case, we can include anything from our learnings from Unit 1 -- whether it be python programming concepts, study skills, learnings about how to be in community, or anything else.

These are a few tools our team recommends: 
* [Google Slide](https://www.google.com/slides/about/)
* [Mind Meister](https://www.mindmeister.com/)

and here is a [more exhaustive list](https://zapier.com/blog/best-mind-mapping-software/) of mind mapping software.

We encourage you to pick a tool and go for it -- no censorship needed.
