# Unit 1 - Reflection Activity

Wow! We've learned so much in the last 5 weeks. Let's take time to reflect on our learning and make connections.

We will use a technique called a mind map. A mind map is a diagram that can represent tasks, ideas, concepts, etc. and the connections between them. 

## Examples

To learn more about the benefits of mind mapping, read this mind map!

Here's a mind map an individual shared of their life which demonstrates the power of making connections across different areas.

## Unit 1 Mind Map

In our case, we will make a mind map based on our learning from Unit 1 at Ada. It can include anything from python programming concepts, to study skills, to learnings about how to be in community.

We will work on our mind maps in small groups in breakout rooms to garner the wisdom of our classmates for approximately 40 minutes. We will come back together as a large group to share our insights. 

Here are a couple tools our team recommends: [Google Slide](https://www.google.com/slides/about/) and [Mind Meister](https://www.mindmeister.com/).

Here is a [more exhaustive list](https://zapier.com/blog/best-mind-mapping-software/) of mind mapping software.

We encourage you to pick a tool and go for it -- no censorship needed.
