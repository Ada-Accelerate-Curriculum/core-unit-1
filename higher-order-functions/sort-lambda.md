# Sort / Lambda

## Learning Goals

* Define lambda functions
* Describe how to use the key parameter in the `sorted` function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key

## Introduction

Imagine we have a list of movie titles we'd like to sort alphabetically. Python provides a couple convenient functions for this task. The [`sort`](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sorting.html#sorting-basics) method can be called on a list and sorts the list in place. The `sorted` function take a list as a parameter and returns the sorted list.  

But what if we have a list of dictionaries representing movies that we want to sort by title, or perhaps by rating. Or perhaps we want to find the most recent movie or oldest movie in a list.

Python provides the `key` parameter for `sorted` function. The `key` parameters takes a function that provides the key to use for sorting purposes. 

In this lesson, we will use the list of movie dictionaries example described above to learn about *lambda expressions* and how they are used with the key parameter in the `sorted` function.
