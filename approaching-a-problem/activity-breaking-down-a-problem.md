# Activity: Breaking Down a Problem

## Goal

Our goal is to practice taking a problem, and pulling it apart into separate steps. When we practice this, our brains should consider how to describe a process, and chunk it into approachable steps. It should be challenging to slow down and think through these!

## Activity Instructions

Follow the instructions about how and when to fill in the prompts below. For each prompt, describe the process in smaller, detailed steps. Put your steps in a list format. Imagine a ten-year-old using these steps to solve each problem.

There should be at least three steps in each prompt.

### Example

Problem: Preparing dinner for tonight

Preparing dinner for tonight:
- Find a recipe
- Make a list of ingredients we need to buy
- Go shopping for the ingredients we need
- Cook dinner

## How to Review

- Share in small groups. Take notes about what steps and approaches others took that you didn't take.
- Reflect on any patterns or trends you see
- Reflect if you were more detailed, less detailed, or as detailed as your small group. (There are no right answers! Different answers are better for different things)
