# Activity: Representing Data

Below are some suggestions for how to facilitate this activity

## Suggested Activity Instructions

Get into small groups. Find an environment where each member is able to share notes with the rest of the group.

For each prompt...

1. Spend 3-5 minutes answering individually, recording your answers in your own notes
1. Go around the group, sharing answers in 1-3 sentences
   - Each member should speak at least once. Talk out loud, practice vocabulary, and practice talking through your reasoning and thought process.
1. Collect any questions that arose, and find the answers with each other
   - We encourage curiosity, but don't let your group get stuck in the details!
   - Collecting questions to answer later is also a great strategy

The group should go at their own pace. However, don't get stuck in the details.

When there are 15 minutes remaining, all groups should work on Prompt #5 if they haven't started already.

## How to Review

- Outside of small groups, share answers for the last prompt
- Spend care talking about the situation and the reasoning behind that data structure
