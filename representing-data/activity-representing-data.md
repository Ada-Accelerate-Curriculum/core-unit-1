## Goal

Our goal is to practice going from word problem to data structure, and to catch each other's mistakes and correct ourselves. At the end of this activity, we should have talked to other humans, and made sure that we can talk about these data structures and why we made them, too.

### Question 2: Adapt to a Dictionary

Consider this table of data, which represents the summary of a patient's last doctor visit.

| Form Field         | Patient Answer                                      |

| Test Summary       | Satisfactory                                        |

From any part of this data, make a meaningful dictionary.

### Question 3: Create a Table

Consider this situation:

Imagine there is a small online conference named "Cool Dev Conf." The organizers collect and analyze attendee info during each conference, so they can understand which years and conference events were the most popular. Cool Dev Conf is held yearly. The conference has many different event types: long talks, short talks, panels, workshops, and affinity groups. After 3 years of running Cool Dev Conf, Cool Dev Conf started to provide different tiers of scholarship tickets in order to encourage new attendees.

Make a table that is meaningful to this situation. Add in some example data. Be intentional about the rows and columns in the table.

### Question 4: Adapt to a Data Structure

Consider your table of data from Question 3. Adapt any part of that data into either a list or a dictionary.

### Question 5: Data in Your Life

Come up with something in your life that has data. Make a table from that data. Then, make either a list or dictionary from it.
