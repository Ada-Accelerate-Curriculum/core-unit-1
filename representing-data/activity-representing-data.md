# Activity: Representing Data

<!-- Can be async -->
<!-- Preferred synchronous -->
<!-- Ideal Format: Small groups -->

## Goal

Our goal is to practice going from word problem to data structure, and to catch each other's mistakes and correct ourselves. At the end of this activity, we should have talked to other humans, and made sure that we can talk about these data structures and why we made them, too.

## Activity Instructions

1. Get into small groups
1. Spend a short amount of time answering one prompt individually. Record your answers in your own notes
1. After some time, check your answer with the other group members
    - Each member should speak at least once. Talk out loud, practice vocabulary, practice talking through reasoning and your thought process.
1. If there are differences, talk with each other to discuss why
1. If there are questions, questions, or ambiguity, find the answers with each other
    - We encourage curiosity, but don't let your group get stuck in the details!
1. Move to the next prompt and repeat the process

## Prompts

Q1: Give them a table of data. Tell them to adapt part of it into a list
Q2: Give them a table of data, tell them to adapt it to a dictionary
Q3: Give them a generic scenario. Tell them to create a table to represent the data
Q4: Tell them to adapt part of it into a list or dictionary
Q5: tell them to come up with something in their life to get data from
Suggestions: family tree, shopping list, some game you play, catalog of comic books 

## How to Review

- Outside of small groups, share answers for the last prompt
- Spend care talking about the situation and the reasoning behind that data structure
