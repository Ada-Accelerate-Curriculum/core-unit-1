Intro to Decorators:

- Tried to make it clear, but seriously the only thing that students need to apply in OOP is reading/using `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod`
    - But this could be a REALLY good intro to functions passed around, so that's why this also exists as a nice pre-reading
- Ryanne uses they/them and she/her pronouns intentionally

Static Methods and Class Methods:

- This material isn't applied in the projects (and isn't something we really need to emphasize besides exposure)
