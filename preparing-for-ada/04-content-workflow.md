# Content Workflow
You should currently be able to view several units in Learn. In addition to the About Ada and Precourse units, you should see topics listed under the units CS Fundamentals, Software Development Tools, Projects, and Lightning Talks.

The topics under these further units are content we expect you to have reviewed prior to your first day at Ada in addition to the primary Precourse unit content. As we progress through Units 1-3, we will be adding further topics to these units.

For specific topics, we will host optional Precourse Live sessions in the [Auditorium Zoom Room](aud-accel.adadev.org) from 4:30-6:30 PST on the following dates to review more

Precourse Live will be presented in a Flipped Classroom. Even if you don't plan to attend Precourse Live sessions, the dates provide good milestones for completing the Precourse curriculum.
