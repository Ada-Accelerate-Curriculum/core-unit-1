# Content Workflow
You should currently be able to view several units in Learn. In addition to the About Ada and Precourse units, you should see topics listed under the units CS Fundamentals, Software Development Tools, Projects, and Lightning Talks.

We expect students to have a thorough understanding of the topics under these additional units prior to your first day at Ada in addition to the primary Precourse unit content. As we progress through Units 1-3, we will be adding further topics to these units. 

## Precourse Completion Requirements

To complete Precourse, you must implement and submit the project Viewing Party. 

All other content is optional and intended to serve as a resource for you to review and fill in any gaps in your knowledge base. You are not required to complete all problem sets or challenge questions contained within the Precourse curriculum. We suggest that you skim all of the topics and fully complete problem sets or challenge questions for any topics you feel you need more practice with. 

## Suggested Content Workflow

Below is a more detailed suggested workflow through the Precourse Curriculum. Some topics will have dedicated review sessions with instructor support through our Precourse Live sessions.

## Precourse Live
For specific topics, we will host optional Precourse Live sessions in the [Auditorium Zoom Room](http://aud-accel.adadev.org) from 4:30-6:30 PST on the following dates to certain topics in more depth. We encourage you to attend any sessions where you feel extra review of the topic would strengthen your understanding of the material. 

Precourse Live will be presented in a [flipped-classroom](https://omerad.msu.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=162:what-why-and-how-to-implement-a-flipped-classroom-model&catid=27:teaching) style. We will expect students to have reviewed content prior to the session. In class, students have the opportunity to ask questions, review concepts, and work on exercises.

## Accessing Help

In addition to Precourse Live, we will have instructor and TA office hours available for student questions. We also have the #study-hall channel in Slack available for questions and the Study Hall Zoom at [accel-study-hall.adadev.org](http://accel-study-hall.adadev.org) where you can meet to work through content with peers. We encourage you to lean on your fellow Adies as well as instructors and TAs for help!

We suggest reaching out for help if you have been unable to debug or answer your own question after 15 minutes. If you are unable to receive an answer from your peers immediately, move on and come back to the content.
