# Debugging With VS Code

Python is widely used with VS Code and so VS Code's developers have put the time in to integrate the Python debugger into the standard VS Code plugin for Python.

In this lesson we will learn to connect VS Code and the Python debugger to help us fix errors in our code.

## Learning Goals

By the end of this lesson we should be able to...

- Set up VS Code to run the Python debugger
- Run the Python debugger in VS Code to step through a program
- Use breakpoints, and watches to identify errors in code
