# TDD Exercise

https://github.com/AdaGold/tdd-exercise

The TDD Exercise is introduced as part of the problem set (Part 1) and parts 2 and 3 are meant to be a classroom activity. This classroom activity likely needs 2 hours.

Many folks are not familiar with BlackJack. Hopefully by providing the prompt as part of the problem set students will have time to review the rules.
    - If not knowing the rules of blackjack proves to be an impedement to the learning goals, we should probably replace the prompt for this exercise.

As with TDD Ping Pong, a `requirements.txt` is not currently provided. Here are a few suggestions for how to run this exercise related to the `requirements.txt`.
- We could not use venv and use the globally installed pytest for this exercise
- We could use venv and install pytest and create a requirements.txt
- We could create a `requirements.txt` in the repo and model creating a venv and installing the requirements

In C15 and C16 we introduced `requirements.txt` and `venv` with the first project.
