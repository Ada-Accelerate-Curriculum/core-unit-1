# TDD Exercise

Old Repo: https://github.com/AdaGold/tdd-exercise, not used because students haven't learned how to collaborate in Git yet.

The TDD Exercise is introduced as part of the problem set (Part 1) and parts 2 and 3 are meant to be a classroom activity. This classroom activity likely needs 2 hours.

Many folks are not familiar with BlackJack. Hopefully by providing the prompt as part of the problem set students will have time to review the rules.
    - If not knowing the rules of blackjack proves to be an impedement to the learning goals, we should probably replace the prompt for this exercise.
