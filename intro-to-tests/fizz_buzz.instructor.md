# TDD Ping Pong

## Goals
- Demonstrate TDD workflow and the Red-Green-Refactor cycle
- Demonstrate writing Unit Tests with Pytest

## Resources
The live code repo: [TDD Ping Pong /Fizz Buzz](https://github.com/AdaGold/tdd-ping-pong).

## Guidelines
The suggested way to run this live code is one instructor writes a test and then the other instructor implements code to make the test pass. The second instructor then writes the next test.
